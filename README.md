# ResNet-Transfer-Learning-CIFAR100

## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model designed to enhance image classification performance on the CIFAR100 dataset. Using ResNet blocks for deeper network architectures and applying transfer learning techniques, this project aims to significantly improve model accuracy and generalization.

## Key Features
- **ResNet Enhancements:** Incorporation of ResNet blocks to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem and improve the modelâ€™s depth and generalization.
- **Mixup Data Augmentation:** Utilization of the mixup technique to extend the training dataset and encourage the model to learn robust decision boundaries.
- **Transfer Learning:** Application of transfer learning to fine-tune the entire network, achieving notable improvements in both training and test accuracies.

## Results
- Achieved a test accuracy of 78.7% on CIFAR100 by enhancing the base network with ResNet blocks and advanced data augmentation.
- Improved generalization through mixup, boosting test accuracy by 5%.
- Applied transfer learning to fine-tune the network, resulting in a test accuracy of 56.08%.
